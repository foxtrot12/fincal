New customer at REPO RATE : - All new floating rate loans and credit limits renewed with effect from October 01, 2019 will be linked to Repo rate.
<br>
Existing customer at MRR/BPLR/Base rate/MCLR: - Existing loans and credit limits linked to MRR/BPLR/Base rate/MCLR shall continue till repayment or renewal, as the case may be. Only if existing customers approach us and give request for switching from MRR/BPLR/Base rate/MCLR to REPO RATE then only it will be changed. Once transitioned to REPO RATE, the customer canâ€™t switch back to the old benchmark rates. <br><br>
